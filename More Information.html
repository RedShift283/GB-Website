<h3><b><i><u> History and Evolution of ICT </u></i></h3></b>
<p><h4>
The concept of ICT can be traced back to the 19th century with the development of the telegraph and the telephone. These two inventions revolutionized the way people worked and interacted socially by making it possible for one person to communicate with another person in a different location in real or near-real time. 

In the middle of the 20th century, radio and television introduced the concept of mass communication, and by the end of the century, the internet had become a mainstream tool for communication, commerce and entertainment. Its use continued to grow rapidly in the following years, revolutionizing the way people work and digitally transforming the way people communicate.

<h3><b><i><u> Information and Communication Technology Basics </u></i></h3></b>
<p><h4>
ICT is often used as a synonym for information technology (IT), but the two terms can have slightly different meanings when used in different contexts. In the United States, for example, the acronym ICT is used in more often in education because in that context, IT can also mean instructional technology. In some industries, IT only applies to enterprise computing, while the broader label ITC encompasses both IT and communication technologies.

Using IT and ICT interchangeably can lead to confusion, particularly in situations where the distinction between the two is important. For example, a job posting that requires expertise in IT may be different from one that requires expertise in ICT, as the latter may require additional skills that specifically support communication and collaboration tools.

<p><h4>
IT is often considered to be a subset of ICT that deals with the technical aspects of managing information, while ICT is a broader term that encompasses both IT and communication technologies.

While IT deals primarily with computer hardware, software, and networking technologies, ICT includes not only these technologies but also communication technologies such as telegraph, telephone, radio and television.

<h3><b><i><u> ICT Infrastructure and Systems </u></i></h3></b>
<p><h4>
Information and communication technology includes a wide range of information, telecommunication and support tools and services that work together to facilitate communication.<br>
This includes:
<ol>
<li>Hardware and software that supports the way information is created, disseminated, acquired and stored.</li>
<li>Infrastructure and electronics that enable communication between hardware devices.</li>
<li>Protocols and interfaces that enable seamless communication and data exchanges between different hardware and software components.</li>
<li>Tools for protecting sensitive information and ensuring the integrity of an ICT system.</li>
<li>Standards for protecting data in transit, during processing and at rest</li>
<li>Governance policies for how information should be accessed, secured, processed, transmitted and stored.</li>
<li>Workers who have the skills required to design, develop, maintain and support ICT systems.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<i>ICT infrastructure includes information technology, telecommunication technology and the services they support.</i>
