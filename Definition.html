<h3><b><i><u> What is ICT? </u></i></h3></b>
<p><h4>
Information and Communications Technology (ICT) is the use of computing and telecommunication technologies, systems and tools to facilitate the way information is created, collected, processed, transmitted and stored. It includes computing technologies like servers, laptop computers and software applications, as well as the wired and wireless communication technologies that support telephones, the Internet, the Internet of Things (IoT) and the metaverse. The goal of ICT is to improve access to information and and make human-to-human, human-to-machine and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication easier and more efficient.



This broad label includes the infrastructure and telecom components that enable synchronous and asynchronous communication across short and long distances. It consists of telecommunication and cloud computing services as well — and the governance policies that support their use.

The importance of ICT cannot be overstated because it has become the foundation of modern society — driving innovation, enhancing productivity and fostering global connectivity.
